# Election_Analysis<br><br>

In this module challenge, I have been asked to help in with the election analysis for the State of Colorado and their respected Election Commission.  I will be using Python Code through Visual Code Studio to assist the confirmation, analysis, and audit of election results.  In this election analysis, I will be performing calculations as well as  calling data from the election results csv file. <br><br>


**Overview of Election Audit**<br><br>
The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:<br><br>
•	The voter turnout for each county<br>
•	The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count<br>
•	The county with the highest turnout<br>
