# Election_Analysis<br><br>

In this module challenge, I have been asked to help with the election analysis for the State of Colorado and their respected Election Commission.  I will be using Python Code through Visual Code Studio to assist the analysis, confirmation, and audit of election results since we have ~370K lines of raw data.  In this election analysis, I will be performing calculations on as well as calling data from our election results csv file. The data consists of a number for the ballot ID, a name for the county, and the candidate who received the vote.  <br><br>


**Overview of Election Audit**<br><br>
For this audit to be well received, trust and respected, we will need to we need to read, process, and analyze, data in the file.  The foundation of our analysis is built around a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received as well as which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes.  The election commission has requested some additional data to complete the audit:<br><br>
•	The voter turnout for each county<br>
•	The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count<br>
•	The county with the highest turnout<br>

Below is an image that captures the entirety of the analysis and audit that we completed for the State of Colorado Election Commission.  This information is found in the terminal when we run the script.  As we work our way down the bullet points, the image can be found in the text file that was created and stored within the Resources folder - the file is title Election Results.

You will see that between the three candidates, the votes were distributed as follows:<br><br>
Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of vote and a total of 85,213 votes.  Diana DeGette received a total of 73.8% of the vote which translated to a total of 272,892 votes cast in her favor.  More on her in the bullet point below.  Raymon Anthony Doane was the lowest vote getter of the evening with the candidate receiving 3.1% of the total vote for a total number of 11,606 votes.<br><br>
